A review contains the pros and the cons of the professor and a few ratings.  
A review screen also contains two boxes at the top, one with the user who submitted
the review and one with the professor that the user reviewed. Pressing either 
one will take you to a profile screen.  

At the top of a professor's profile screen, you will find the professor's university
and their faculty. You can press either one and it will take to a profile screen.  
Below that, you will see the professor's rating and a list of their reviews.
You will also see a Add Review button. Pressing it will take you to the 
review submittion screen.
